# Pokemon-Analytics

Like many kids in the late 90s and early 2000s, I was a Pokemon fanatic. I spent many hours on my Gameboy or Nintendo DS trying to yes- ‘Catch them all’- but also be the best Pokemon trainer I could be, which meant I wanted to create the best Pokemon team. While as a kid, I simply caught the Pokemon I thought looked cool - that I had a certain affinity for - and as an adult I haven't grown out of my fascination with these pocket monsters, but I've grown wiser in my methods. This repo is meant to be a personal project exploring how we can quantify the competitive edge Pokemon have on one another and the methods we might take to identify the 'best' Pokemon team.

## Methods

Initial analytics will be based mainly on general stat lines and typing advantages/disadvantages. Although this doesn't give specifics to each pokemon, and generalizes them under their typing and stats, we will also explore a more robust analysis with real data from a compeititve pokemon environment and how indiviuals perform in an ecosystem of tons of other pokemon beyond just their typing advantages, etc.
